### Stack
This repository uses Node.js on the backend, serving a React.js frontend via [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev). [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is used to run a JavaScript-based HTTP server, and [Express-Rate-Limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) is paired with said HTTP server to implement rate limiting.
